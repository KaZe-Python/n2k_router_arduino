= N2K gateway =

The project reads a bunch of different sensors (right now just a NMEA0183 GPS from UART) and push the relevant PGNs to the N2K network.
It also listen to the N2K, decode the CANBUS frame and push the PGNs to WiFi on UDP.

The project depends on Timo Lappalainen's NMEA2000 library (and related dependencies): https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000
